# 3D model of the puzzle (my own design only)

* board.stl : base board, common for three types of piece sets.
* easy.stl : easier version (10 smaller pieces)
* normal.stl : moderate difficulty (9 pieces)
* hard.stl : hard version (8 larger pieces)
* puzzle.blend : blender file of the design

## print tips

* To give a different color to the texts and grid lines, use "pause at height" function of Cura slicer to switch the material during 3D print. Change the material at height=1.5mm.
