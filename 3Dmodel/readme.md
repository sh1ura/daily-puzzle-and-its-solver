# 3D model of the puzzle (my own design only)

* Since the design of <a href="https://www.dragonfjord.com/product/a-puzzle-a-day/">A-puzzle-a-day</a> is registered (patented), I do not provide the 3D model of original design.
* My original design has square 7 x 7 field without blocked grids (already occupied placements) that are seen in the top-right and bottom-right of the field of "A-puzzle-a-day". Instead, I placed six '*' grids that are always free for the pieces. Months and dates are not separeted but mixed.
* Three types of pieces with different difficulties are provided. Number of pieces are 8, 9 or 10.
